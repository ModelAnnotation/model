The starting rule file is the previous uploaded one.  MPF is accumulating in the nucleus incorrectly so that is where I will begin.  Looks like import begins to exceed export around step 500.  I am also not liking the centrosomal build up.  It is slow and low.  Need to keep in mind that the activation paradigm for the normal state that I am following is centrosomal activation first.  Cytoplasmic levels look ok.  As part of the activation I see a smooth decline in the amount of CDK1 pT14. This decline should be very gradual, then very rapid at the onset of mitosis.  This is probably linked to the nuclear build up since fully active MPF can modify CCNB1 preventing export.  Modification of the NucPore for fast transport is correct.  CCNB2 pS133 is accumulating too fast as is the pS126 & pS128.  The latter are MPF in cis, the former is Plk1.\nNote 10:   Reduce the cis autophosphorylation rate of the CDK1 pY15 by 0.1.  Perfect, the behavior is now a switch.  CCNB1 pS133 is still too fast.  As soon as pS126 & pS128 is formed pS133 is formed. \nNote 82:   Make the phosphorylation of CCNB1 @ S133 absolutely dependent upon pS266+pS128 by setting rate to 0.  This did not change anything.  Plk1 rate it plain too fast.  \nNote 10:  Reduce the CDK1 pY15 dependent autophosphorylation rate to 0.01.  Liking the result even more.  The switch phenotype is more pronounced.  Now need to get CCNB1 pS133 to behave more like a switch.\nNote 82:  Reduce the rate of PLK1 by a factor of 0.1.  That did not work so well.   The pS133 never really accumulated.  Nuclear MPF stayed low.  Mitosis only moved from ~2000 to ~2400.  Will tweak that next just to slow things down.\nNote 41:  CDC25a partial activation of MPF.  Removed the S124~U requirement since this appears to only be a location marker.  Added S178~U requirement since pS178 inhibits the enzyme.  As expected this had a modest impact.  Caused a slight delay in activity which is good.  Next is to address the intracellular trafficking issue.  Slightly too much in the cytoplasm and not enough in the nucleus.\nNote 38:  Scale import rate by a factor of 0.5, no change to export rate.  That did it.  Looks like about 90% in nucleus.  The wacky oscillations of inactive WEE1 are getting more pronounced.  Not too concerned about that for the moment.\nNote 9:  Reduce MPF activity toward H3 by 5 fold using factor 0.1.  This rule is going to need a phosphatase or something to give it a true switch behavior.  Better though.  Nuclear MPF is spiky and the amount of pS133 is still not accumulating correctly.  Also keep in mind that fast transport is off.  PLK1 rates from Note 82 are probably close as there is very little active PLK1.  Need to take a step back here and look at how the MPF activation cycle with the CDC25\'s is working.  Inactivation of PLK1 with drugs will delay mitotic entry.

I suspect the system is working as a PLK1 depletion at the moment since there is negligible activation.  Ok, CDC25a first.  Intracellular trafficking is what I want, ~90% nuclear but moving.  Looks like most of it is pS178 and pS124.  pS124 is both Chk\'s and pS178 is Chk1.  There is no mechanism to remove those phosphorylations in the model. \nNote 41:  Add T507~U requirement for binding to MPF and remove S178~U from unbinding reaction.  This didn\'t change the profiles much.  Not still have what looks like inactive 25a.  There is a lot of pS178, not so much pT507.  This is because pT507 is only Chk1 while pS178 is both Chk\'s.\nNote 41:  Added a rule counter to find out how often 25a interacts with MPF.  25a hardly interacting with MPF at all.  This is consistent with the activation state of 25a and suggests that 25b might be too active.\nNote 31:  Moved the counter to 25b.  Way too active.  By step 1000 25b has interacted with MPF over 100 times.  By the time of mitosis it is over 2000 times.  That is way more active than intended.  Problem is the rules.  25b is complex and the rates get added together.  The only thing keeping MPF activity in check is pkMyt1.\nNote 31:  Set pS99 rates to 0.   Looking for dominant rate.  That slowed it down.  Repeat run with pS99 observable set.  The nuclear 25b all converts to pS99 around step 2000.  This also coincides with the nuclear accumulation of 25b.  Ok, export requires S99~U.  I cannot recall why I did that.\nPlk1_kOn_Basal rate reduced 10 fold to 0.000001, all that did was help stabilize the inactivation of WEE1.  There might be a couple of issues here.  Note 79 is the only case were I have PLK1 T210~U able to function.  In the real world there is some kinase activity with that but I think that needs to be zeroed out.  The other is the nuclear export of 25b.  Should not be inhibited by pS99.\nNote 79:   Make PLK1 activity dependent upon pT210.  Had no effect on profile.  The PLK1 rate is way too high toward 25b.  Move counter here and run again.  Way too much activity here.  Change this to Plk1_kOn_Basal.  Results in almost no PLK1 activity toward 25b.  Model hits mitosis near 4000.  Getting somewhere now.  Behaving like a PLK1 depletion. \nNote 80:  Require PLK1 pT210 for activity.  This is against 25c.  This was the last place that needed changing for this requirement.  Good, this made no difference in profile. \nMade serious changes to the model.  Remove S99 from 25b, add T50, T167, and S209.  T167 and S209 is PLK1.  T50 is MPF and priming site for PLK1.  T167 disrupts S151 and S209 disrupts S230.  Need to get the new rules written for T50 and 14-3-3.\nNote 90:  Remove the ability of B151 and B230 to be simultaneously occupied.

Decided that B151 and B230 can never be simultaneously occupied.  This is a little muddy since one paper suggests that 14-3-3 Sigma can bind in the absence of B151 and B323. Goal is to get 25b finished today.  Added collapsible sections to Observable list to help make code easier to read.  Test run to remind myself of my location.  Too much 25b in cytoplasm.  Likely due to 14-3-3 not regulating correctly.  Begin with Chk phosphorylation targets.  Want activity against S323 to be relatively high.  Also good activity against S151.  Going to make S230 the DNA damage site so make it slower unless Chk2 is fully active.\nNote 63:  Require fully active Chk1 for phosphorylation of S230.  Trying to skew this toward Chk2 after damage.  Still too much pS230.\nNote 51:  Require fully active Chk2 for S230 AND alter seed species removing pS230. Still has almost all 25b having pS230.  This is regulated at Note 26 and Note 71.\nNote 71:  Increase the rate by a factor of 10.  The problem is phosphatase cannot access this when 14-3-3 is bound.  Doesn\'t look like it did much.  Add counter and repeat run.  PP2a is not firing much, about 250x.  Oops made a mistake.  Forgot to increase the nuclear rate.  Repeat run.  Somewhat better, about 350.\nNote 71:  Add the B230 requirement.  This will reduce the count even more.  Next is to look at how active Chk1 and Chk2 are toward 25b.  Count stops at 140 @ step 2000.  Something is wrong.  Add counters to the binding rules as well.  No evidence of unresolvable complex formation.  Count freezes in nucleus first.  Check transport kinetics by first looking for binding to Importin or CRM.  That is not the problem either.  \nNote 91:  Turn off B230 binding.  I think I found it.  B230 is impacting transport way to much.  The count appears to be do to a transport issue. Examine that next.  This molecule is a mess.  OK, better.  Stays about 60/40 (N/C) until around step 3000 which is near mitosis in the current system.  Still too much pS230.  Do this next.  Counter shows that PP2a is active. \n\nNote 27:  Have three export rates; 1, 2, 3 slowest to fastest.  I have rate 1 restricted to B151 AND B230.  This combination is no longer allowed.  Change rate 1 to B151 OR B230.  Rate 2 is not used now.  Better but still a little more cytoplasmic than I want.  Slow export rate 1 by a factor of 10.  YES.  Now 50/50 more or less.  Could tweak import a little to get it more like 60/40.  Increase slow import (B323) from 0.002 to 0.003.  That did not work.  Now 60 cyto, not nuclear.  Increase slow import to 0.0045\n\n Move counters to Note 63 (Chk1 off) and Note 52 (Chk2 off).  Both way too active.  Reduce rate of active Chk\'s by factor of 5. That didn\'t do much.  Reduce each by factor of 10.  Set all rates but active to 0 in these two Note groups.  Chk1 way too active.  Chk2 now dead.  Reduce Chk1 active by factor of 10.  This makes the active and partial rates equal. Chk1 is still just plain too active.  Very little B345!+ in the cell.  Reduce by a further 10x.\nNote 18:   This is CDK1 modification of 25b. Set to 0 to better isolate 25b.\n\nNote 52 and Note 63:  Note enough activity toward S323 from either.  Need most of the 25b with pS323.  Increase rate of all here by 5.  Better.  Now test seed species.  80% pS151 + pS323 and 20% S151 + S323.  Getting better.  Still more pS151 than pS230.  Should be other way around.  \nNote 69:  Reduce the 14-3-3 off rate by 2.  Want B323 to live somewhat  by itself.  Good, all the pS323 has 14-3-3 bound.  Still too much free B151.  Should not be much if any.\nNote 90:  This is the low affinity site so reduce the on rate by a factor of 2.  No change.  Increase the off rate by a factor of 5.  Still no go.  All the pS151 is bound and that is allowing free B151 to exist.  Change the on factor from 0.5 to 0.1.  Marginal improvement.  Change factor on unstable form to 0.05, leave other at 0.5.  Amazing, little improvement.  Change factor for reversible on to 0.001.  No change.  Set reaction to 0.  Try adding an unbinding reaction that can occur anywhere that is dependent upon B323.  This helped, very little free B151 now.  It might be as good as it gets.  One last try at changing the starting ratio of P/U to 70/30.  Excellent, almost all the B151 now lives with B323.\nNote 90:  Back to B230.  Add a rule that stimulates disassociation if B323!+ not present.  Add a one-way rule to get it bound, same low rate as B151.  B230 binding is still too fast and there is too much pS230.\nNote 52 and Note 63:  All the pS230 is coming from Note 63 (Chk1).  Set cytoplasmic rate to 0. Not much change.  Scale active Chk1 against S230 by 0.1.  Cut the amount of pS230 by about half.  Scale by 0.01.  No change.  Move counters to the three k_On reactions for Chk1.  These rules are not firing.  Move counters to the three state change rules for this group.  The state change reactions are firing based on how many total complexes exist, not how many specific.  This is an NFsim glitch.  Try adding a specific marker to the components.  Added X~1~2~3~4 to CHK1.  This allows unique ID of CHK1 interacting with the same molecule three different times.\n\nMany changes to rates and added rules for 25b interacting with PP2a and generic kinase.

I am hopeful that this is behaving as a PLK1 depletion.',1,7,'2013-10-17 12:35:59','2013-10-17 23:11:37','1_1382065897.bngl'),(16,'Use the October 17, 2013 build.

I know the 14-3-3 binding is not correct resulting in overly active 25c.  This may also be impacting the location. \nNote 70:  Added B263 binding rules back and made binding of B216 and B263 more efficient if both are present.  Ok, results in too much B216 by itself and B216 bound when pS216 is not present.\nNote 70:  Add rules to break complexes if pS216 or pS263 is not present. Getting there.  Need to look into phosphorylation of S216 and S263 now.\nNote 72:  Restrict dephosphorylation to 25c that does not have 14-3-3 bound.  Very little pS263 in the system.  Also way too much B216 bound without B263.  25c is not being phosphorylated.  Counters placed to monitor this are all nearly 0.  pS216 is there from the instantiation of program.\nNote 65:  This is the pS216 phosphorylation.  Add the marker to make sure the pS263 rules don\'t mix here.  Also increased the CHK1 rates for this reaction by 10.  No change.\nNote 54:  Add the marker to the Chk2 pS216 rules.  Most of the pS216 appears to be coming from the generic kinase reaction. Added counter to pS216 generic kinase reaction.  The generic kinase count is over 1000 but the Chk1 and Chk2 counts are staying close to 0.  This is even with the increase in rates for the Chk\'s.  Have systematically increased the CHK1 rates by 5000x.  Stumped.  The Chk1 rules just will not fire.  Only about 10% of the 25c is in the form CHK1 or CHK2 can work on. \nNote 84:  Reduce generic kinase rate by 0.1.  This actually increased the count on CHK1.  Look into Kinase jamming things up.  Not jammed here.  Maybe this reaction is just so likely to occur that it dilutes the amount of substrate available to other reactions. \nNote 72:  Reduce the PP2a rate by 0.1 for the pS216 site.  Subtle changes.\nNote 54 and Note 65.  Scale the rate for all the CHK\'s by 500x.  Getting better.  Look into the pS263 rates.  Currently there is essentially none.  May need to add markers to PP2a and Kinase as well. Markers added to PP2a and Kinase as well as CHK1 and 2 for pS263.  Made some changes but still not enough pS263.\nNote 70:  Looking at 14-3-3 rates.  There is too much B216 without B263\nTweaking rates.  Reduce PP2a, increase CHK\'s toward pS263.  Found a potential issue with pS214 production.  Set to 0 and still get some.  Must be some cross talk in the rules.  The amount of pS216 and pS263 looking better.  No bound 14-3-3 now.  Still looking at 14-3-3.  The counter here has +15k for events.  For some reason the off rate is too high.  Found the error.  Note 70 complex dissolution had the off rate S214~U, S263~P.  Should have been S214~P, S263~P.  That fixed it.  Now balance the 14-3-3. \nLooks to be fairly close now.  The transport is noisy but mainly has 80 - 90% cytoplasmic with wild fluctuations.  Mitosis is still entered around step 2400.  PLK1 will likely speed this up.  The amount of bound 14-3-3 crashes as it should around the time of mitosis.  This will require some more finesse.  Also the feed back with MPF needs more finesse.  Need some code to slow down MPF phosphorylation of CDC25b if 14-3-3 is bound or binding sites phosphorylated.\n\nStill issues with 25b and MPF.  When fully active MPF is allowed to phosphorylate 25b it causes a traffic jam.  MPF/25b complexes build up.  Trying to slow the whole thing down.  This is what needs to be tackled next.

Literature tells us that S321 is not phosphorylated until just prior to or very early in mitosis.  Strongly suggests that CDK1 Y15~U is required.  Looks like the 14-3-3\'s are hanging on after the MPF phosphorylation.  Let\'s tackle that next.  First break Note 18 into three notes\nNote 18a:  Set the rate here to get a significant amount of pS160 produced.  Beginning to look into why 14-3-3 does not appear to release.  All the pS160 is in the context of pS151.  Suggests that all or almost all the S151 is phosphorylated.  Need to look at this a bit as well.  The amount of B151 flat-lines suggesting that there is an unresolvable complex somewhere containing B151.  Well, there is no B151!+ with pS160 so that rule is working correctly.  The flat-line represents the stability of the B151!+ complex.  I do not allow CDK1 T14~U, Y15~P to phosphorylate that complex.  I also do not allow PP2a to work on pS151 in the presence of B151!+.  The literature tells us that pS151 inhibits pS160.  This is not clearly separated from B151!+.  I will use the presence of B151!+ to inhibit the formation of pS160.  Need to slow this down more anyway.\nNote 18a:  Scale the rate by a factor of 0.01 for the CDK1 pY15.  Nice.  Got more B151!+ and limped into mitosis around 2600.\nNote 18b:  Set rate to 0.  There are no downstream rules with this species so this change has no immediate effect.  I want this to be a DNA damage response that requires PLK1 to remove B230!+.  This way there can be no recovery without PLK1.\nNote 18c:  The literature is a bit muddled here.  pS321 does not appear until there is active MPF.  There is some evidence that B323!+ may exist without B151!+ or B230!+.  This goes against how 14-3-3\'s are thought to bind.  Current runs have this rate scaled by 0.01 with fully active MPF at 0.  Try turning on fully active at 10%.   Not good.   The amount of B151!+, B323!+ double is flat and the amount of B323!+ increases very slowly both after step 800.  The amount of pS151 is slowly dropping.  I think this is because the only 25b that MPF is modifying is not bound to 14-3-3.  The flat-line is because there is no mechanism to break the complex without PLK1 or MPF.  The slow decrease in pS151 is because PP2a can interact with B151!+ present.  The model is functionally PLK1 null and this is an important PLK1 function.  Add a spontaneous complex disruption rule for now?\nNote 18a:  Add rules for fully active MPF scaling the rate to 10%.  These rules are not dependent upon B151!+ being present. Not making any pS160 to speak of.  Remove scaling on the active MPF rate.  The flat-line not so flat any longer.  Add Observable code for 25b pS160+pS321.   This species is made but not as much as I would think.  There is a lot of pS321 and a lot of B323!+.  No Mitosis. \nNote 18c:  Rule missing S321~U requirement.  Now mitosis occurs, nice switch with the B151!+ to B151.  B323!+ not coming off even with huge accumulation of pS321.  Found Note 69 rate at 0.  Nice.  Mitosis at 2600.  Graph profiles suggest switch behavior for 25b.  My need to slow things down a bit. \nTrying to slow things down somewhat.  Scale off rate at Note 69 and on rate for Note 18a by a factor of 0.1.  For now I am going to leave these as they are.

To recap, CDC25a and CDC25b appear to be regulating correctly although I think slightly too fast.  Today the plan is to look at CDC25c and confirm it is doing what is expected.\nNote 70:  The 14-3-3 binding appears to follow the expected pattern.\nNotes 22 & 23:  The nuclear trafficking is not bad.  Looks like we are getting ~90% cytoplasmic with ~90% of the 25c B216!+ and B263!+ positive.  This has messed with Mitosis somewhat.  There is no loss of the bound 14-3-3\'s prior to mitosis.\nNote 65:  Before I go too far I need to confirm the CHK1 phosphorylation rate.\nActivation loop with MPF not correct.  Very little pS214 when mitosis. \nNote 25:  Add counters to find out what is happening.  Active 25c counter is in the thousands.  This rate is way too fast.  I see this in the output.  Significant accumulation of CDK1 pT14, Y15.  Reduce the 25c active rate by 7 fold.  Difference between basal and active now 10x instead of 70x.  Reduced count on active by about 20% but still in the many thousands.  Partial is not firing at all.  Strange.  The pS214 is being derived from the S216 25c, not the pS216.\nNotes 12 & 13:  Set rates to 0.  These are causing cross-talk in NFsim.  Now some of the 25c B216!+ is getting converted to pS214.  Not enough.  The feed-back is not working correctly. \nNote 25:  Remove basal activity of 25c.  Note 14:  Require partial MPF activity to be dependent upon B216.  Nothing changed.  There is very little MPF activity toward 25c.\nNote 12:  Restore function and add component marker.  This is the CS key.  Maybe not enough in CS.  Note 14:  Add component marker.  No change.  Not accumulating pT130.  Had an error in pT130, was restricted to NU.  Change to CS.\nI am thinking I am on the wrong track here.  Do a 8000 step simulation to see what is going on.  Still no mitosis.  Something went sideways here. \nAdded PP2a rules to remove pT130 that is not in CS.  Also altered rules that are doing the CS transport.  Now CS 25c slowly builds to about a value of 20.  System is getting into mitosis again. Turned off MPF autophosphorylation and NucPore fast transport.  Want it to continue to cycle normally for the moment while I try to determine why 25c activity will not amplify.  There is a distinct possibility that the absence of PLK1 activity is playing a role here.  Running the model with 8000 steps.  Just noticed something.  The amount of CDK1 T15 pY15 reaches a steady state.  Take a peak at 25a and 25b again.  \nNote 40:  Factor the 25a CS export rate by 0.1x.  Note 41:  Factor the rate by 5x.  That increased the amount of 25a in CS to a steady state of about 10.  Increases the amount of CDK1 T14, pY15.  Mitotic entry at 5000.  Nice switch on MPF full activation.  Still no switch on 25c.\nNote 25:  Found that this is firing thousands of times.  Add additional counters here and try and determine what is going on.  It is all coming from the CS.\nNote 72:  Add counter here as well.  Still searching for reason Note 25 CS is firing so often.  This is not the cause.  This rule hardly fires.  \nAdd Component marker to 25c.  My only guess is NFsim is crossing rules somewhere.  Ok, that slowed mitosis to 6000.  No other change.  Still no activation of 25c and Note 25 is firing thousands of times. \nNote 14:  Add CP to possible locations.  This pattern says that as fast is Y15 is made it is converted to pY15.  That might be where to look next.  The primary kinase for that is Wee1 and without PLK1 it is harder to kill.  Damn, it worked.  Step 6200 mitosis occurred, 25c activated and so did MPF.  This is without fast transport or nuclear accumulation of MPF.  Note 25 is still firing thousands of times and the PP2a removal of pS214 also fires thousands of times.  Repeat run to make sure this wasn\'t a statistical fluke.  Did not enter mitosis or activate.  Try it again.  Strange, this time it went in.  Est. step 7000.  Run again.  Went in, took 7500 steps. \nTry a tweak on 25b.  pS321 spikes then more or less levels off around 3000.  This phosphorylation, when B323!+ is present, requires CDK1 T14,Y15.  So add PP2a removal in cytoplasm and nucleus to try and damp it down some.  Worked.  Spike is closer to mitosis.  Need a few more tweaks on 25b.  B323!+ is partial activity and should be bound without B151!+.  Need to look at this closer. \nMake a PP2a rule for H3 to make mitosis more of a switch.  Still not quite correct since MPF transport is not balanced correctly.',1,7,'2013-10-24 08:54:33','2013-10-24 20:35:41','1_1382661341.bngl'),(20,'Adjusted various transport rates and added rules for PP2a on several molecules to get rapid switch behavior.

Currently reading and uploading publications getting ready to make rule changes.  Needed changes:\n1.  Plk1 T495 is a very minor site.  The S426 site accounts for the majority of PLK1 activity toward pkMyt1.  This is from Nakajima et al., 2003.\n2.  CDK1 is a poor substrate for pkMYT1.  Likely that CCNB1 binds to pkMyt1 allowing the reaction.  Two publications show that CDK1 is a poor substrate when it is not bound to CCNB1.  Make this change in the model.  Liu et al. 1999 present evidence that it is indeed CCNB1 that mediates binding.  the Liu paper also demonstrated that ~10% of the pkMyt1 is bound to CCNB1 at any given time and that over-expression of pkMyt1 blocks MPF in the cytoplasm delaying mitosis.  This trait is not in the model and should be considered.\n3.  Because of #2 make the kinase that adds pT14 to unbound CDK1 be the generic kinase.  Since the generic kinase is not regulated, restrict the activity to unbound CDK1 only.   \n\nNote 15 and 20.  Move binding to CCNB1.  Note 20:  Move the free CDK1 pT14 and pY15 to Kinase.  Changes were successful, no alteration in patterns. \nRegulation of pkMyt1 is more based on synthesis and degradation.  Means that MPF interacts with it over 10k times to phosphorylate.  Add counters to Kinase/CDK1 reactions to set rates as low as possible.  Got the count down.\n\nNote 35:  Add counter.  Synthesis is many thousands.  Note 19:  Add counters here as well looking at slow and medium degradation.  Not nearly fast enough account for the amount of synthesis.  Add counter for fast degradation.  Fast degradation is occurring too early and amounts to the majority of the degradation.  This section needs to be balanced.  This means too much PLK1 activity and no requirement for a Plk1 priming phosphorylation.  Calling it quits for today.  Will continue work to balance pkMyt1 tomorrow.',1,7,'2013-10-27 12:33:26','2013-10-27 18:53:20','1_1382914400.bngl'),(22,'These are from Oct. 28, 2013.\nServer is down so I am taking notes with Notepad++.  When the server is back up I will copy these to the site.  Begin with previous build file.  Goal to to balance pkMyt1 synthesis and destruction rates so that the reactions are not firing tens of thousands of times.\n\nNote 83:	This is Plk1 modification of pkMyt1.  Zero these out.\nNotes 19 & 35:	Add counters to these to monitor synthesis and degradation.  Both counters show many many thousands.  The steady state amount of pkMyt1 under this condition is about 400.  That number is ok.  Need to reduce the synthesis and degradation rates significantly.\nFactor each rate by 0.01.  Steady state is about 90.  That is too low for no Plk1.  Increase the synthesis rate by 10x.  I am shooting for a steady state here of 300 to 400.  Never stabilizes.  Reduce the synthesis factor back to 0.01 and the degradation factor to 0.001.  No good.  Increase too slow.  Change the synthesis factor to 0.05, keep the degradation the same.  Increase is very slow and does not plateau.  Degradation counts stay close to 0.  Set the synthesis factor to 0.1 and the degradation factor to 0.05.  Plateaued well after mitosis just shy of 300.  I don\'t think I can get the system to stabilize where I want it with a seed value for pkMyt1 of 75.  Increase this to 300.  Not bad.  Total pkMyt1 increased to about 420 then plateaued.  Try slightly slowing the overall synthesis rate to 0.001 while keeping the overall degradation rate at 0.000004.  For now I will keep this.  The amount of pkMyt1 stays in the 290 to 300 range.  The synthesis count slowly increases to around 90 at the time of mitosis and the degradation count is slightly above that.  Overall I think this must mean that that amount of pkMyt1 is very slowly dropping.  Try one more run with a synthesis rate of 0.0015.  Love it, on average at early time points synthesis = degradation.  Amount is constant at about 300.  Later it climbs slightly.  Set final synthesis rate to 0.0012.  Now onto others.\nNote 15:  These were factored by 20x.  Set factor back to 1.  Under these conditions of excess pkMyt1 due to incorrect Plk1 regulation the system did not reach mitosis in 8k counts.  The system started to tip but just did not make it.  Try increasing each rate by 2x.\nNote 20:	pkMyt1 phosphorylation of CDK1 is based on T461~U, nothing else.  Change rules to reflect this.  Done.\nNote 36 (synthesis) and Note 85 (degradation):  Add counters.  Zero out Plk1 stimulated degradation.  Total Wee1 appears to be stable at ~375 (good) but the counters are in the many thousands (bad).\nChange the Wee1 synthesis and basal degradation rate to be the same as pkMyt1.  Set seed species to 300.  Amount of Wee1 creeps up.  Tweaking degradation rate to try and get this down and have degradation actually do something.  Now at 0.0001, now a bit fast.  Bump synthesis slightly to 0.0016 while holding degradation the same.  Not doing anything.  Increase synthesis to 0.002, much better.  Increase to 0.0023, that is much worse.  The equations that are generated sometimes behave strangely with some rates.  Make the rate 0.003, I am good with this now.  Synthesis is approximately equal to degradation on average.\nSo what to do next?  Wee1 activates early.  This is probably fine but it appears to inactivate somewhat early as well which is not so fine.  Can\'t make it inactive close to when pkMyt1 dies.  Does not make sense.  Need work tomorrow.  To finish I removed the PP2A interactions with Wee1 and pkMyt1.  Back to working but Wee dies before Myt.  That is where I should start.

Mutations in the S323 14-3-3 binding site appear to block most if not all 14-3-3 binding.  There might be some sigma that can still bind S230.  This is a nuclear localized 25b and a very active 25b.  Mutation of S151 and/or S230 results in a slightly more active 25b with more protein in the cytoplasm.  The increased cytoplasmic protein may account for the increased activity since 25b with a mutated NLS is also more active.  Data suggests that there is still 14-3-3 bound to S323 in this case.

The S323 site is the high affinity binding site and this site is generally occupied if pS323 and S321 exist.  When this site is unoccupied the activity is increased.  When S151 is unoccupied the acitvity also increases with no apparent change in the amount of 14-3-3 bound.  Complicating this whole thing is activity is usually measured as premature mitotic entry, G2 checkpoint override, or a reduction in the length of G2.

In metazoans, S phase onset coincides with activation of Cdk2, whereas Cdk1 triggers mitosis. Both Cdk1 and -2 require cyclin binding and T loop phosphorylation for full activity. The only known CDK-activating kinase (CAK) in metazoans is Cdk7, which is also part of the transcription machinery. To test the requirements for Cdk7 in vivo, we replaced wild-type Cdk7 with a version sensitive to bulky ATP analogs in human cancer cells. Selective inhibition of Cdk7 in G1 prevents activation (but not formation) of Cdk2/cyclin complexes and delays S phase. Inhibiting Cdk7 in G2 blocks entry to mitosis and disrupts Cdk1/cyclin B complex assembly, indicating that the two steps of Cdk1 activation-cyclin binding and T loop phosphorylation-are mutually dependent. Therefore, by combining chemical genetics and homologous gene replacement in somatic cells, we reveal different modes of CDK activation by Cdk7 at two distinct execution points in the cell cycle.','Requirements for Cdk7 in the assembly of Cdk1/cyclin B and activation of Cdk2 revealed by chemical genetics in human cells.','839-50',7),(2,'Nature',1990,346,6282,1,2142754,'','The cell cycles of early Xenopus embryos consist of a rapid succession of alternating S and M phases. These cycles are controlled by the activity of a protein kinase complex (cdc2 kinase) which contains two subunits. One subunit is encoded by the frog homologue of the fission yeast cdc2+ gene, p34cdc2 and the other is a cyclin. The concentration of cyclins follows a sawtooth oscillation because they accumulate in interphase and are destroyed abruptly during mitosis. The association of cyclin and p34cdc2 is not sufficient for activation of cdc2 kinase, however; dephosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues of p34cdc2 is necessary to turn on its kinase activity. The activity of cdc2 kinase is thus regulated by a combination of translational and post-translational mechanisms. The loss of cdc2 kinase activity at the end of mitosis depends on the destruction of the cyclin subunits. It has been suggested that this destruction is induced by cdc2 kinase itself, thereby providing a negative feedback loop to terminate mitosis. Here we report direct experimental evidence for this idea by showing that cyclin proteolysis can be triggered by adding cdc2 kinase to a cell-free extract of interphase Xenopus eggs.','Triggering of cyclin degradation in interphase extracts of amphibian eggs by cdc2 kinase.','379-82',7),(3,'Cell',2005,122,1,1,16009132,'','The regulated oscillation of protein expression is an essential mechanism of cell cycle control. The SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases is involved in this process by targeting cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation by the proteasome, with the F-box subunit of the SCF specifically recruiting a given substrate to the SCF core. Here we identify NIPA (nuclear interaction partner of ALK) as a human F-box-containing protein that defines an SCF-type E3 ligase (SCF(NIPA)) controlling mitotic entry. Assembly of this SCF complex is regulated by cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA, which restricts substrate ubiquitination activity to interphase. We show nuclear cyclin B1 to be a substrate of SCF(NIPA). Inactivation of NIPA by RNAi results in nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1 in interphase, activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity, and premature mitotic entry. Thus, SCF(NIPA)-based ubiquitination may regulate S-phase completion and mitotic entry in the mammalian cell cycle.','NIPA defines an SCF-type mammalian E3 ligase that regulates mitotic entry.','45-57',7),(4,'The Journal of cell biology',1991,115,1,19,1717476,'','We have used immunofluorescence staining to study the subcellular distribution of cyclin A and B1 during the somatic cell cycle.

The first cyclins to be isolated were the A- and B-type cyclins and we have been studying their behaviour in human somatic cells. The levels of both cyclin A and B1 are regulated transcriptionally as well as post-translationally; both are rapidly and specifically degraded in mitosis. Cyclin A synthesis commences at the start of S phase and the protein is predominantly nuclear, whereas cyclin B1 appears during S phase and is primarily cytoplasmic. Cyclin B1 moves into the nucleus just at the start of mitosis and associates with condensed chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. Both cyclin A and cyclin B1 bind to and activate a protein serine/threonine kinase subunit; cyclin A associates with p33cdk2 and with p34cdc2, whereas cyclin B1 seems to bind exclusively to p34cdc2. Cyclin A-associated kinase activity appears much earlier in the cell cycle than that of cyclin B1, which appears only at the G2 to M transition. Therefore cyclin A may play a role in the events of S phase as well as G2 and M phases. Cyclin A forms a cell cycle-dependent complex with p33cdk2 and the transcription factor E2F, although the function of this complex is not yet clear. We conclude that cyclins A and B1 may differentially regulate the cell cycle in several ways. They form complexes with distinct protein kinases and these complexes are active at different times in the cell cycle; they form distinct multiprotein complexes, such as with the transcription factor E2F; and they are localized to different parts of the cell where different substrates will be available to them.','Cyclins A and B1 in the human cell cycle.','187-204',7),(12,'Annual review of cell and developmental biology',1997,13,0,17,9442875,'','Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play a well-established role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell division cycle and have also been implicated in the control of gene transcription and other processes.

Degradation of cyclin B via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway seemed to be absolutely required for the M-phase exit. However, inhibition of the proteasome proteolytic activity upon the exit from the meiotic metaphase II-arrest in Xenopus cell-free extract revealed that the proteasome-dependent dissociation of cyclin B from CDK1 is sufficient to inactivate MPF without cyclin B degradation. In this study we analyze whether the same mechanism operates during the exit from mitotic M-phase. We show in Xenopus cell-free extract undergoing the first or the second embryonic mitosis that CDK1 oscillations are not affected by proteasome inhibition with MG132 or ALLN despite effective inhibition of cyclins B degradation. The majority of cyclins B1 and B2 surviving CDK1 inactivation is CDK-free and cyclin B2 becomes resistant to phosphatase lambda dephosphorylation. The pool of cyclins B remaining after CDK1 inactivation in the presence of MG132 is mitotically inert, while exogenous or newly synthesized cyclin B activates CDK1. This suggests that cyclins B remain sequestered within the proteasome upon MPF inactivation in the presence of MG132. Comparison of the dynamics of the decline of total and CDK-bound pools of cyclins B1, B2 and B4 upon mitotic exit in absence of protein synthesis reveals that CDK-bound cyclins B diminish clearly faster. Our results thus show that cyclin B dissociation from CDK1 precedes cyclins B degradation upon CDK1 inactivation in mitotic embryo extracts and that proteasome proteolytic activity is dispensable for both activation and inactivation of CDK1 in such extracts.','Cyclin B dissociation from CDK1 precedes its degradation upon MPF inactivation in mitotic extracts of Xenopus laevis embryos.','1687-98',7),(15,'The International journal of developmental biology',2007,51,4,17,17554681,'','Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is the enzymatic subunit of M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF).

However, MPF inactivation actually precedes cyclin B degradation in Xenopus cell-free extracts. Here we study in details the temporal relationship between histone H1 kinase (reflecting MPF activity) inactivation, Thr-161 dephosphorylation, CDK1-cyclin B2 dissociation and cyclin B2 proteolysis in such extracts. We show an asynchrony between inactivation of histone H1 kinase and degradation of cyclin B2. CDK1 dephosphorylation on Thr 161 is an even later event than cyclin B2 degradation, reinforcing the hypothesis that cyclin B dissociation from CDK1 is the key event inactivating MPF. Cyclins synthesized along with MPF inactivation could deliver shortly living active MPF molecules, potentially increasing the asynchrony between histone H1 kinase inactivation and cyclin B2 degradation. We confirm this by showing that in the absence of protein synthesis, such a tendency is lower, but nevertheless, still detectable. Finally, to characterise better CDK1/cyclin B dissociation, we show that CDK1 begins to dissociate from cyclin B2 before the very beginning of cyclin B2 degradation and that the diminution in CDK1-associated cyclin B2 is faster than the decline of its total pool. Thus, neither cyclin B2 degradation nor Thr-161 dephosphorylation participates directly in CDK1 inactivation as measured by histone H1 kinase decline upon the exit from mitotic M-phase in Xenopus embryo extract.','Cyclin B2/cyclin-dependent kinase1 dissociation precedes CDK1 Thr-161 dephosphorylation upon M-phase promoting factor inactivation in Xenopus laevis cell-free extract.','297-305',7),(16,'Molecular biology of the cell',2011,22,21,72,21900495,'10.1091/mbc.E11-02-0136','Mitosis is triggered by the abrupt dephosphorylation of inhibitory Y15 and T14 residues of cyclin B1-bound cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 that is also phosphorylated at T161 in its activation loop.

The obtained results show that a hydrophobic amino acid at position +1 carboxyl-terminal of phosphorylated Ser/Thr and an acidic amino acid at position -2 are important for optimal phosphorylation by Plk1.

In higher eukaryotes, Cdc2 activity is in part regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15, catalyzed by Wee1 and Myt1, which prevents catastrophic premature entry into mitosis. In this study we defined the function of Myt1 by overexpression studies in both S. pombe and a human osteosarcoma cell line. Similar to Wee1, overexpression of human Myt1 prevented entry into mitosis in both cell types; however, Myt1 catalytic activity was not essential for the cell cycle delay observed with human cells. Myt1 expression was restricted to proliferating cells. Furthermore, we detected no major decline in Myt1 protein abundance prior to the entry into mitosis, which coincides with the loss of Myt1 activity. We localized mitotic phosphoepitopes, recognized by the monoclonal antibody MPM-2, to the C-terminal domain of Myt1. The mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1, was able to associate with this domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Truncation of the C-terminal domain of Myt1 prevented its ability to induce G(2)/M phase arrest in overexpression studies in human cells and dramatically reduced its ability to phosphorylate Cdc2 in vitro. We demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Myt1 was required for recruitment of Cdc2, and we infer that this domain lies in the cytoplasm because it can interact with and is phosphorylated by Cdc2. In conclusion, we propose that Myt1 can negatively regulate Cdc2/cyclin B1 and inhibit G(2)/M progression by two means, both of which require the C-terminal domain; first, Myt1 can bind and sequester Cdc2/cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm preventing entry into the nucleus, and, second, it can phosphorylate associated Cdc2/cyclin B1 at Thr14 and Tyr15 thus inhibiting its catalytic activity.','The C-terminal domain of the Cdc2 inhibitory kinase Myt1 interacts with Cdc2 complexes and is required for inhibition of G(2)/M progression.','3361-71',7),(43,'The Journal of biological chemistry',1997,272,35,72,9268380,'','Activation of the Cdc2.cyclin B kinase is a pivotal step of mitotic initiation.

The study of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and polo-like kinases (Plks) as evolutionary conserved regulators of the cell cycle has contributed significantly to our current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the proliferation of mammalian cells. Given the importance of Plk1 for mitotic progression the temporal expression of Plk1 is crucial and has to be tightly regulated. It is known that steady-state Plk1 mRNA and protein levels are coordinately regulated during cell cycle progression, being low during interphase but high in mitosis. This review will summarize the current knowledge on how cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation of the Plk1 gene is achieved. While binding sites for various transcriptional activators are dispersed throughout the entire Plk1 promoter region, the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the Plk1 gene expression seems to be regulated by G1-specific repression rather than by G2/M-specific activation of the Plk1 transcriptional unit. The tumor suppressor gene p53 was identified as a key player in the precise restriction of Plk1 gene expression to the G2/M phase. The activity of p53 is in turn controlled by Plk1 itself indicating the existence of an auto-regulatory mechanism involved in the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the Plk1 gene.

Here we show that downregulation of PLK1 expression occurs through a transcriptional repression mechanism and that p53 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect. Repression of PLK1 by p53 occurs independently of p21 and of arrest at G₁/S where PLK1 levels are normally repressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner through a CDE/CHR element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that p53 is present on the PLK1 promoter at two distinct sites termed p53RE1 and p53RE2. Recruitment of p53 to p53RE2, but not to p53RE1, is stimulated in response to DNA damage and/or p53 activation and is coincident with repression-associated changes in the chromatin. Downregulation of PLK1 expression by p53 is relieved by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, and involves recruitment of histone deacetylase to the vicinity of p53RE2, further supporting a transcriptional repression mechanism. Additionally, wild type, but not mutant, p53 represses expression of the PLK1 promoter when fused upstream of a reporter gene. Silencing of PLK1 expression by RNAi interferes with cell cycle progression consistent with a role in the p53-mediated checkpoint.

Here, we report a novel regulatory role of TPX2 and show that it protects Aurora-A from degradation both in interphase and in mitosis in human cells. Specifically, Aurora-A levels decrease in G2 and prometaphase cells silenced for TPX2, whereas degradation of Aurora-A is impaired in telophase cells overexpressing the Aurora-A-binding region of TPX2. The decrease in Aurora-A in TPX2-silenced prometaphases requires proteasome activity and the Cdh1 activator of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase.

These include regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, achieved by the phosphorylation by GSK3 of nuclear substrates (e.g. numerous transcription factors). We resolved this mechanism by identifying a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that is necessary for the nuclear accumulation of GSK3beta and is sufficient to drive yellow fluorescent protein into the nucleus. Despite the NLS, most GSK3beta is cytosolic, sequestered in protein complexes that, although still mobile in the cytosol, block the NLS. Conditions promoting nuclear translocation of GSK3beta release it from cytosolic complexes, allowing the NLS to direct nuclear import. Using this information to prepare a nucleus-excluded active GSK3 construct, we found that the antiapoptotic effect of GSK3beta in tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis is mediated by cytosolic, not nuclear, GSK3beta.

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by the binding of growth factors initiates GTP loading of RAS, which triggers the initial steps in the activation of the ERK pathway by modulating RAF family kinase function. Once activated, RAF participates in a sequential cascade of phosphorylation events that activate MEK, and in turn ERK. Unbridled signalling through the ERK pathway caused by activating mutations in RTKs, RAS or RAF has been linked to several human cancers. Of note, one member of the RAF family, BRAF, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in the kinase superfamily. Not surprisingly, there has been a colossal effort to understand the underlying regulation of this family of kinases. In particular, the process by which the RAF kinase domain becomes activated towards its substrate MEK remains of topical interest. Here, using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, we demonstrate that RAF catalytic function is regulated in response to a specific mode of dimerization of its kinase domain, which we term the side-to-side dimer. Moreover, we find that the RAF-related pseudo-kinase KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) also participates in forming side-to-side heterodimers with RAF and can thereby trigger RAF activation. This mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the longstanding conundrum about RAF catalytic activation, and also provides an explanation for the capacity of KSR, despite lacking catalytic function, to directly mediate RAF activation. We also show that RAF side-to-side dimer formation is essential for aberrant signalling by oncogenic BRAF mutants, and identify an oncogenic mutation that acts specifically by promoting side-to-side dimerization. Together, our data identify the side-to-side dimer interface of RAF as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in BRAF-dependent tumorigenesis.','A dimerization-dependent mechanism drives RAF catalytic activation.','542-5',8),(61,'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America',2009,106,27,112,19541618,'10.1073/pnas.0901590106','Scaffold proteins contribute to the spatiotemporal control of MAPK signaling and KSR1 is an ERK cascade scaffold that localizes to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor treatment. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of KSR1 function, we examined the interaction of KSR1 with each of the ERK cascade components, Raf, MEK, and ERK. Here, we identify a hydrophobic motif within the proline-rich sequence (PRS) of MEK1 and MEK2 that is required for constitutive binding to KSR1 and find that MEK binding and residues in the KSR1 CA1 region enable KSR1 to form a ternary complex with B-Raf and MEK following growth factor treatment that enhances MEK activation. We also find that docking of active ERK to the KSR1 scaffold allows ERK to phosphorylate KSR1 and B-Raf on feedback S/TP sites. Strikingly, feedback phosphorylation of KSR1 and B-Raf promote their dissociation and result in the release of KSR1 from the plasma membrane. Together, these findings provide unique insight into the signaling dynamics of the KSR1 scaffold and reveal that through regulated interactions with Raf and ERK, KSR1 acts to both potentiate and attenuate ERK cascade activation, thus regulating the intensity and duration of ERK cascade signaling emanating from the plasma membrane during growth factor signaling.','Signaling dynamics of the KSR1 scaffold complex.','11022-7',8),(62,'Molecular cell',2009,33,2,114,19187764,'10.1016/j.molcel.2008.12.026','The LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway serves as a critical cellular sensor coupling energy homeostasis to cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

We find that in these cells LKB1 is phosphorylated by ERK and Rsk, two kinases downstream of B-RAF, and that this phosphorylation compromises the ability of LKB1 to bind and activate AMPK. Furthermore, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of LKB1 allows activation of AMPK and inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth.

This phosphorylation promotes the association of BRAF with 14-3-3 proteins and disrupts its interaction with the KSR1 scaffolding protein, leading to attenuation of the MEK-ERK signaling.

Inhibition of Raf-MEK pathway activation by IMP occurs through the inactivation of KSR, a scaffold/adapter protein that couples activated Raf to its substrate MEK1. The capacity of IMP to inhibit signal propagation through Raf to MEK is, in part, a consequence of disrupting KSR1 homo-oligomerization and c-Raf-B-Raf hetero-oligomerization.

Substitution of these residues by alanine (B-RafAA) abolished Ras-induced B-Raf activation without altering the association of B-Raf with other signaling proteins. Phosphopeptide mapping and immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that Thr598 and Ser601 are in vivo phosphorylation sites induced by Ras.

Con sistent with these data, B-RafAA and B-RafED exhibited diminished and enhanced ability, respectively, to stimulate ERK activation and Elk-dependent transcription. Moreover, functional studies revealed that B-RafED was able to promote NIH 3T3 cell transformation and PC12 cell differentiation.

Mutation of ATM causes defective cell cycle checkpoint activation,a reduced capacity for repair of DNA double strand breaks and abnormal apoptosis, all of which contribute to the major features of A-T including genome instability, increased cancer risk and neurodegeneration. While the exact mechanism of activation remains unknown, it is clear that the Mre11 complex plays an important role both in the recruitment of ATM to the sites of DNA damage and in the efficient activation of ATM. Although ATM responds to agents that produce double strand breaks in DNA, other stimuli are also capable of ATM activation. The description of autophosphorylation on S1981 of ATM and the ensuing transition from an inactive dimer to an active monomer represents a major milestone in our understanding of the activation process. However, it is now evident that more than one autophosphorylation event is required and not surprisingly this process is also attenuated by phosphatases and other modifications such as acetylation are also implicated. This is further complicated by a recent report that autophosphorylation at S1987 (the mouse site corresponding to S1981) is dispensable for Atm activation in an Atm mutant mouse model. Use of cell extracts and in vitro approaches in the reconstruction of activation complexes have shed further light on what it takes to activate ATM.

In this study, we mapped a nuclear localization signal (NLS), 385KRKK388, within the amino terminus of ATM and demonstrate its recognition by the conventional nuclear import receptor, the importin alpha1/beta1 heterodimer. Although mutation of this NLS resulted in green fluorescent protein (GFP) x ATM(NLSm) localizing predominantly within the cytoplasm, small amounts of nuclear GFP x ATM(NLSm) were still sufficient to elicit a DNA damage response. Insertion of an heterologous nuclear export signal between GFP and ATM(NLSm) resulted in complete cytoplasmic localization of ATM, concomitantly reducing the level of substrate phosphorylation and increasing radiosensitivity, which indicates a functional requirement for ATM nuclear localization. Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal half of ATM, containing the kinase domain, which localizes to the cytoplasm, could not autophosphorylate itself or phosphorylate substrates, nor could it correct radiosensitivity in response to DSBs even when targeted to the nucleus by insertion of an exogenous NLS, demonstrating that the ATM amino terminus is required for optimal ATM function. Moreover, we have shown that the recruitment/retention of ATM at DSBs requires its kinase activity because a kinase-dead mutant of GFP x ATM failed to form damage-induced foci. Using deletion mutation analysis we mapped a domain in ATM (amino acids 5-224) required for its association with chromatin, which may target ATM to sites of DNA damage.
