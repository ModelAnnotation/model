		<h3 id="important notes"><strong>A) Important notes make sure you read this!</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Please note that the Megazoom installation and configuration is not complicated but because it has a lot of customizable settings it might seem complicated, please go through the entire documentation before trying to install it into your own page. Basically what it must be done is to copy some html code from the examples we provided and paste it into your own html page and of course replace the image with your own.</p>
		<p>The server is character case sensitive so make sure that the Megazoom settings are identical to those from the provided examples.</p>
		<p>Please note that on mobile the images are rasterized by the operating system.</p>
		
		<h3 id="preparingImages"><strong>B) Preparing the image.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The Megazoom can handle any type of image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg). Save your image with a width or height smaller then 6000px, higher resolutions are possible but is not advised, also if a navigator small image is required just save a smaller version of the image depending on the original image size and format.</p>

		<h3 id="instalation"><strong>C) How to install Megazoom into your html page.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This is a small tutorial about how to install the Megazoom into your page. There are three types of display for this Megazoom, responsive/fixed, fullscreen and lightbox. The responsive/fixed display type allows the Megazoom to be embedded into a html page inside a div of your choosing, the Megazoom will adapt its width and height based on the div which acts as its parent, if the page is resized and the parent div is resized with css or javascript the Megazoom will adapt its size. The fullscreen display type will display the Megazoom in fullscreen mode, this means that the Megazoom will fill the available browser width and height. The lightbox display will open the Megazoom into a lightbox over the content of the page.</p>
	
		<h4><strong>Installing the Megazoom with a responsive or fixed display:</strong></h4>
		<p>In the download files there are five .html files which are ending with _responsive_or_fixed.html, each of this examples have exactly the same structure, only some constructor settings, css classes, skin and image are different, you can use one of them to copy and paste the needed html code based on skin that you need, I will use the skin_round_silver_responsive_or_fixed.html the one with the world map as reference but any of the .html files which are ending with _responsive_or_fixed.html will do fine. Also what is important to note is that each .html file has associated a folder which contains the image, skin and a global css file which is used for customizing the markers/hotspots, the folder name is related to the .html file name it is self explanatory.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Copy and paste the skin_round_silver folder and the java folder into the same folder with your .html file, inside the skin_round_silver folder there are other folders which are self explanatory, the easiest way to add images is just to replace the images that we are using, don't forget to set the image <span class="boldLi">imageWidth</span> and <span class="boldLi">imageHeight</span> options into the Megazoom constructor (<a href="#config">constructor parameters</a>), this is really important.</li>
			<li>Open skin_round_silver_responsive_or_fixed.html with a text editor.</li>
			<li>The javascript and css files must be imported, in the head section of your html file add the code from the below image.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/script.jpg"></img>
			<li>You need a div into which the Megazoom will be added as a child, so create a div and set an id for it, the id is important because it is passed in the Megazoom constructor, make sure it is unique. The Megazoom is responsive so if you set a width or height of 600px to the created div the Megazoom will adapt based on that, please note that I have used inline css to set the width and height of the div but you set the div size with a css class or javascript, example in the image below.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/div.jpg"></img>
			<li>Next step is to copy and paste in the body of your html page the div with the id megazoomPlayList, the id is important because it is passed in the Megazoom constructor (pleae note that this id can have any label id does not have to be "megazoomPlayList"). This div is containing the data for the markers and info window, it is required even if you don't use any markers, if this is the case just leave it blank. Please note that the image that is illustrating this is minified, to view the full content check out the html page content.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/playlist.jpg"></img>
			<ol>
				<li>The first ul tag, the one with the attribute data-info represents the html content for the info window, this window appears when the info button is pressed, if you don't need the info window delete this ul tag but make sure to remove the info label from the <span class="boldLi">buttons</span> option in the Megazoom constructor as well (<a href="#config">constructor parameters</a>).</li>
				<li>The second ul tag the one with the attribute data-markers is used to setup the markers/hotspots, please read the <a href="#markers">how to setup the markers/hotspots</a> section, if you don't need markers/hotspots then delete this tag.</li>
			</ol>
			<img src="assets/images/skin.png"></img>
			<li>Next step is to initialize the Megazoom with javascript, in the head section of your html page add the code from the below image. Please note that all parameters are described in the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section</li>
			<img src="assets/images/instantiate.jpg"></img>
			<li>This are all the step needed to setup the Megazoom, again all this code is located in any of the five .html files which are ending with _responsive_or_fixed.html so you can copy and paste the code easily without errors. Please make sure to read the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section to understand all the Megazoom properties.</li>
        </ul>   
		<h4><strong>Installing the Megazoom with a fullscreen display:</strong></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Follow the exact same steps as in the "Intalling the Megazoom with a responsive or fixed display" section, the only difference is that there is no need to create a div as a holder for the Megazoom and in the Megazoom constructor the displayType must be set to fullscreen like this displayType:"fullscreen". Please note that there are five .html files included as reference, their labels are ending with _fullscreen.html, if you like you can just use one of this .html files and replace the images.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><strong>Installing the Megazoom with a lightbox display:</strong></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Follow the exact same steps as in the "Intalling the Megazoom with a responsive or fixed display" section, the only difference is that there is no need to create a div as a holder for the Megazoom and in the Megazoom constructor the displayType must be set to lightbox like this displayType:"lightbox" also the constructor is a bit different, instead of instantiating the Megazoom when the page loads it is instantiated when a button  is pressed (it does not have to be a button it can be any html element, like an image or a link). Please note that there are five .html files included as reference, their labels are ending with _lightbox.html. Please open any of the related .html files and check out the installation code.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="config"><strong>D) Constructor parameters.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Please open any of the .html files provided with a text editor as reference.</p>
		<p>These parameters represents the possible setting for the Megazoom they are all visible in the below image and described below.</p>

	    <h3 id="infoWindow"><strong>Setting up the info window.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To add html content to the info window replace the html content inside the ul with the attribute <span class="boldLi">data-info</span>, if there is too much text a scrollbar will appear. If you don't need the info window delete the ul tag with the attribute <span class="boldLi">data-info</span> and also inside the Megazoom constructor remove the <span class="boldLi">info</span> label from the buttons option (please read the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section). Of course this window can have its html content formatted with CSS, we are using the global.css file to style this window.</p>
	   
        <h3 id="markers"><strong>How to setup the markers/hotspots.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Open with a text editor any of the provided .html files for reference this way the code can be copied and paste</p>
		<p>To find the markers position over the image set <span class="boldLi">showMarkersInfo:"yes"</span>, this will show a white box that is containing information about  left, top and current zoom factor, move the mouse over the image on a spot where you want to add the marker... it does not matter if the image is zoomed.</p>
		<p>There are three type of markers/hotspots: link, tooltip and infowindow, they are explained below, they are created visually using two image icons (.jpg, .png or .gif), one for the normal state and one for the selected state when the mouse is over it, also the image size and shape can be any kind. Please note that .gif can be used but on some mobile devices the gif will not animate, only one frame will be displayed!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The link marker type once is clicked or pressed a new browser window will open, the link and target can be specified.</li>
			<li>The tooltip marker type once is rolled over with the mouse or or touched on mobile a popup window will appear, this window can contain any type of html content but be careful not to add too much text, it is useful if you want to show a small chunk of html content. Please note that the elements which this window contains can be styled with css, if you add images make sure that you add the width and height attributes, otherwise the window will not resize properly.</li>
			<li>The infowindow marker type once is clicked or or touched a window will appear over the Megazoom, this window can contain any type and any amount of html content (this window is exactly the same as the info window which appears when the info button is pressed). Please note that the html tags that this window contains can be styled with css, if you add images make sure that you add the width and height attributes, otherwise the window will not resize properly</li>
		</ol>
		
		 <h4 id="markers" class="red"><strong>Create a marker/hotspot of type link and adding it at a specific position.</strong></h4>
		 <img src="assets/images/link.jpg"></img>
		 <p>Above there is an image which represents a graphical representation of how a link type marker is created. The marker from the above image must be added (copy and paste) into the ul tag with the <span class="boldLi">data-markers</span> attribute, the order into which they are added does not matter. The marker data attributes are explained below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-type="link"</span> - this represents the marker type, in this case it is link.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-reg-point="center"</span> - this represents the marker registration point (the marker zoom point), this is a bit difficult to explain but it is easy to use, if you have a marker with a round shape set this option to center,if the marker has a pointer down set it to centerbottom or if the marker has a pointer up set it to centertop.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-normal-state-path="skin_round_silver/skin/marker6.png"</span> - this represents the path for the marker normal state image, it can be a .png, .jpg or .gif format and it can have any size or shape.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-selected-state-path="skin_round_silver/skin/marker6-rollover.png"</span> - this represents the path for the marker selected state image, it can be a .png, .jpg or .gif  file and it can have any size or shape.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-left="3746"</span> - the marker left postion.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-top="386"</span> - the marker top postion.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-width="31"</span> - the marker width, make sure that this has the exact width as the normal or selected image.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-height="31"</span> - the marker height, make sure that this has the exact height as the normal or selected image.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-show-after-zoom-factor="0"</span> - a number between 0 and the specified zoom factor, if you want to show a marker after the image is zoomed for example 60% set this number to .6, this varies based on the way you want to use this.... To always show the marker set this to 0 (zero).</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-tool-tip-label="External Link (the url and target can be specified)"</span> -  the tooltip label which appears when the marker is rolled over with the mouse.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-url="http://www.google.com"</span> -  the url of the window which will be open when the markers is pressed.</li>
				<li><span class="boldLi">data-marker-target="_blank"</span> -  the target of the window which will be open when the markers is pressed (this can be _blank or _self).</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="dynamic"><strong>E) Change image dynamically in the same page</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Before reading this section make sure you understand the  <a href="#instalation">How to install Megazoom into your html page</a> and  <a href="#config">Constructor parameters</a>.</p>
		<p>This section shows how to change the Megazoom image dynamically in the same page, we have provided examples for each skin. Open with a text editor any of the .html files provided in the download files that are ending with "_thumbnails.html". In this examples we have used basic css to create thumbnails and when a thumbnail is pressed the image will change also.</p>
		<p>I will not go into great details about the code because it is fairly simple to understand, what is important to note is that a function called "setupZoomer" is used that accept some parameters (the parameters are self explanatory, also you can add more based on your project), This function is destroying the current Megazoom instance if any and creates a new one based on the function parameters value.<p>
		<p>The examples that we have used in the preview page can be found in the demo folder.</p>
		
		<h3 id="wp"><strong>Install in wordpress:</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>We have tested the megazoom on wordpress version 3.4, if you don't have the latest version then please install it, on an older version the embedding might not work.</p>
		<p>Make sure you read the the other sections in the help file, it is important to familiarize your self with the megazoom settings and what needs to be configured.</p>
		<p>You need a ftp program to connect to your ftp server and upload the megazoom files, I use filezila is a free ftp program.</p>
		<p>Connect to your server and open the folder in which wordpress is located, in my case it is "wp", in that folder upload  any of the files that start with "skin..." based on the skin you would like to use, for example I am using the round skin silver so upload the "skin_round_silver" folder and the "java" folder, the skin_round_silver folder contains the images, skin and css files and the java folder contains the javascript file.</p>
		<p>To embed the megazoom into wordpress first login as an administrator, from the menu open pages, add your page title and select the HTML tab not the VISUAL tab, after you do this copy and paste the text from the wordpress.txt file, replace http://www.webdesign-flash.ro/wp/ with your domain name and your wordpress folder label then save the changes, please note that you might update the image to zoom and navigator path if you chose to give them diffrent labels. To setup markers read the  <a href="#markers">How to setup the markers/hotspots</a></p>
		<p>Please note that the wordpress has it's own set of css rules this is based on the theme, each theme is different, some times this css rules might have higher precedence over the one you declare so if this is the case you must use inline css for the description window or use the !important (this info is useful specially for formatting the tooltip and info windows).</p>
